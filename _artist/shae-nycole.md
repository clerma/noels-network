The most powerful stories are real. They’re the sagas that we grasp on to, learn from, and live with. Shae Nycole tells her story in all its unfiltered, unabridged, and unrestrained glory through her music.

Soulful singer/songwriter/actress and Lake Charles, Louisiana native Shae Nycole is a celebrated R&B recording artist whose debut single ‘Ready’ was independently released in 2015 peaked at \#34 on US Urban AC Top 40 Chart and peaked at \#3 on the Indie Urban AC Charts. Shae explains that Ready, is named for being ready to live fearlessly and love unapologetically, is about turning vulnerability into the power to fuel your own personal evolution.&nbsp; The rising star lays her sweet and soulful voice over timeless melodies to give fans the experience of love’s ecstasy, rejection, and creating memories of dancing and singing along with the ones you love most.

.&nbsp; From the West Coast to Louisiana, Virginia, Alabama, and Mississippi– audiences sold out shows as Shae’s first single climbed the AC Urban charts! Guests who experience her live performances will hear the gospel influence in Shae’s soulful delivery as well as the pitch-perfect notes as suit of an academic classical background.&nbsp; Shae credits childhood choir director, Gladys McKnight, for exposing the eager talent to trailblazing female artists like Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Lauryn Hill and CeCe Winans. These legends influenced Shae’s desire to be a champion of confident, sexy and always classy women. &nbsp; Shae combined her gospel roots, classical training and sultry charm to mesmerize audiences in Music City’s competitive R&B circuit.&nbsp;
