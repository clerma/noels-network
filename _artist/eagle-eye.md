With more than 15 years of experience, I am (DJ Eagle Eye) have truly set myself apart from the crowd. My love for music, and the music industry has placed me in the presence of many big names from Meagan Good, Mystical, and Dougie Fresh, Kid Capri,Bad Boy Dj Finesse, Shaq, Dj J Nice, Cupid, Dee 1, and Max Minelli. Born and raised in Baton Rouge, La. I graduated from Baker High School and then went on to attend Southern University in Baton Rouge, La. It was in my middle school years when I developed a genuine love for music by playing in middle school marching band. As my musical talents grew, my passion turned towards being a DJ and my production skills grew also. Being very fluent with production programs and working in studio as an engineer I’m very divisive. I have DJ everything from birthday parties, weddings, and family reunions to headliner shows for DL Hughley, Mike&nbsp;<br>Epps, Rickey Smiley and Som’more. My talents have also opened corporate doors with Metro PCS, La Capitol Federal Credit Union, and The Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Offices, American Cancer Society and More. I also have a big heart for the community by giving back through my works with Big Buddy, American Cancer Society, and The North Baton Rouge Community center. My talents have taken me beyond the great state of Louisiana. I have gone from Maryland to Texas showing people a great time with great music. Apart from my music, I’m a husband and father of three. I attribute my success to my faith in God using the tag line “God’s number one draft pick”.&nbsp;
