AdoSoul has just started to make a splash on the scene with his modern take on inspirational music that flaunts his gospel roots without negelecting the realness of the obsctacles he has endured fighting to live out his dreams in todays social climate. He is not new to music. He has been performing since a child in his father's group, Bishop Davis & Company, most known for nationally known hit, Holy Ghost Party. After being classically trained at Xavier University of Louisiana, he began his own independent career in the heart of downtown New Orleans performing on Frenchman and Bourbon Street. He has shared the stage with some legendary talent including Melanie Fiona, Lyfe Jennings, Dru Hill, Miguel, David Batiste & The Gladiators,Gary Brown & Feelings,Travis Porter, and The Winans. Currently he is traveling and performing while preparing for the release of his upcoming projects. You can see him live this year May 4th at the Jazz and Heritage Festival in New Orleans.
