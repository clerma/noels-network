Born and raised in Opelousas La

My passion for music started with rapping in junior high school which is when I put out my first single which was released in stores in 1993.&nbsp; My name started to grow but didn't become well-known until 2004.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Internet and social media was not a thing then so footwork and word of mouth was critical then. I recorded in high scale studios but my best work came out of a one room shack which is what actually gave me the attention I needed to be heard and recognized.&nbsp; I traveled a lot making and releasing music then like everything else it slowed down so I took a break for few years. Later I came back onto the scene making and releasing music but it just wasn't sticking like I expected.&nbsp; &nbsp;Clearly I did not understand what was happening or why things weren’t happening the way I envisioned it should be, yet the entire time I was making music I was known as the class clown, the jokester the comedian and eventually someone told me I missed my calling which was to be a comedian because without much effort I had the ability to make people laugh and turn a stormy day into sunshine.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is when the comedy side of me came to life.&nbsp; Since then I’ve been known as K-Chill 1000% and l absolutely love what I do and enjoy bringing laughter into the lives of others.
