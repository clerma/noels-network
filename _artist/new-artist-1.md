David Sylvester started his musical career as a toddler long before he knew what music notes, beats, and tempos meant. He’d become quite skilled at lyrical content creating and tapping into heartfelt emotions through music in his youth. He was heavily influenced by car rides with his mom where he’d sing along as she listened to the great Otis Clay, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, Johnny Taylor, and other R&B and soul artists.

At the early age of 14 he began his professional musical career as a church musician at a COGIC church in Louisiana. When you hear his voice, you can hear how he illuminates the raspy sounds of blues legends Bobby ‘Blue’ Bland and Al Green, who also started as gospel singers.

David released his first full industry standard project in April of 2024 entitled SOUL OF THE SOUTH. It features hit singles such as “Too Blessed”, “In My Arms”, “My Apology”, and “Back in Town” which friends, fans, and family members shared all over social media. But it was his single, “Lonely Hearts” that has gained the momentum to establish a solid reputation in the Soul Blues industry. When asked why should a new fan be interested in his music, Sylvester replied, ‘It’s an honest expression of raw emotion, completely original, and soulful. It also has somewhat of a vintage feel!

This comment reigns true. When you listen to his music you will hear the vintage sounds resembling the great Otis Redding partnered with the sultry vocal rasp that is often compared to artists such as John Legend, Lyfe Jennings, and Anthony Hamilton. A small focus group said that the artist is a person who tends to over think things seeking perfectionism but levels that compassion with a huge heart. David can often be heard stating that. “I’m an old soul with an intense desire to spread love and positive energy everywhere my likeness is represented”.  When asked. “What do you want to be remembered most for?” Sylvester says, “I’d like to be remembered for my courage to be an individual marching to the beat of my own drum. Someone who used his art to make statements that ignites hope and inspires change.”
