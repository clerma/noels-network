My name is JaDarius Flagg, and I’m 25 years old. I was born and raised in Vicksburg, MS, where I grew up singing in church and at many events in the community. I’m a software engineer and tutor of various subjects. Since childhood, I’ve always enjoyed making music and singing. I also like to spend spare time fishing, watching movies, and spending time with family and friends. I soon hope to travel the world and sing, in hopes of changing lives for the better.Attached to this emails are a few photos for the website. I don’t have many professional photos, but you may choose the ones you want from these. Please let me know if I need to send more options.
